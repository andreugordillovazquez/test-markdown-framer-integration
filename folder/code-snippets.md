# Code Snippets and Formatting in Markdown

## Introduction

This document demonstrates how to include code snippets and various formatting options in a markdown file. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## Code Snippets

### Inline Code

To include inline code, wrap the code with backticks. For example, `inline code`.

### Block Code

To include a block of code, use indentation or a different method to distinguish it from regular text. For example:

```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Conclusion

Markdown provides simple ways to format text and include code snippets, making it a versatile tool for documentation and content creation.
